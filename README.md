this is a demo project while joining NCD Certification, I consider working on this demo because of it's value.
We use smart contract to store our assert and relations, such as metaverse lands, human social relationship.
It's cool to save them on contract.

I would like to make all those node in graph as a unique NFT which support NEPS, it will be a good way to encourage people minting on a same graph and share knowladge worldwide.
